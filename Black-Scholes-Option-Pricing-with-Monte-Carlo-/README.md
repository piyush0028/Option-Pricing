# Black-Scholes Option Pricing with Monte Carlo Simulation

This project implements the **Black-Scholes option pricing model** using **Monte Carlo simulation** to estimate the price of European-style options. The notebook also includes comparisons with analytical pricing formulas and explores the impact of varying input parameters such as volatility, maturity, and interest rates.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Simulates Geometric Brownian Motion for stock price paths
- Estimates European call/put option prices using Monte Carlo techniques
- Compares Monte Carlo results with the closed-form Black-Scholes formula
